# THE AXON THEME
This theme is a custom solution for a freelance business, the AXN Creative, by Branon Eusebio. 

# POSTING
Posting requires a few considerations given the development of this theme.
* PROJECTS --> if you want a new post to appear in the PROJECTS section, give it a "type" of "project"
* BLOG --> if you want a new post to appear in the PROJECTS section, give it a "type" of "blog"
* POST vs PAGE --> this theme was designed to offer slightly different layouts for Posts vs Pages. 
- A post type of "post" will go through post.ejs, which renders article-full.ejs.
- A post type of "page" will go through page.ejs, which renders page-full.ejs. 
* Post snippets can display image thumbnails, just include the image path in the "thumbnail" front matter for a given post.
* Post snippets also accept excerpts, just include a string with the excerpt content in the "excerpt" front matter for a given post.

# BLOG vs PROJECTS
This has been touched on, but it's also important to note that to edit the primary content of the BLOG or PROJECTS page, create/edit the page with a type of "blog-page" or "projects-page"
