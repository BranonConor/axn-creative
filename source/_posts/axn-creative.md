This site was built on a framework called HexoJS, a "static site generator" that offers incredible speed and templating capabilities all essentially within the front end. This site was constructed from scratch, sporting a unique theme built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Static site generators provide a way to update and manage site content quickly and easily, without ever needing to make a call to a database.
