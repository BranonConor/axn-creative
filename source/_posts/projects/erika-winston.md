ErikaWinston.com is a website for a massage therapy and bodywork practitioner. This client wanted to rebrand her site, so I provided complete design reworking in Figma, and consequential development thereafter. 

This helped provide the modern-looking, sleek site she desired to help deliver her business out of the 1990s and into the new age. 

More work is to be done, but it's coming along wonderfully.
