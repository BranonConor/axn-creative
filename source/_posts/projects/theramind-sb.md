This site was built on a framework called HexoJS, a "static site generator" that offers incredible speed and templating capabilities all essentially within the front end.

This site is a JAMStack application, which utilizes Javascript (the HexoJS framework on the front end), API interaction (in this case, Netlify CMS which uses Github's API to change static files in the repository), and Markdown files which are rendered into post/page content. 

This tech stack together offers blazing fast, secure, applications that render everything at build time. No databases to maintain, less security access-points, more fun!
