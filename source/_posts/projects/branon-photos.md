BranonPhotos.com is a photography portfolio website. As an award-winning freelance photographer, I've spent much of my career packing as much detail and rich sharpness into my photos as possible. I've also chased hi-resolution image formats and cameras that slap you silly with insane megapixelage. 

To my surprise, web development taught me to pursue exactly the opposite. I found very quickly that huge images ruined site performance, and made the site essentially useless.

The challenge in this site was serving all of my art in a way that maintains its visual detail whilst optimizing page speed performance. I managed to strike a balance by resizing my images and compressing them as well. Though more work can definitely be done in that department, I am at least happy that my images remain beautiful and that the site improvement has vastly improved.
