# What a time to be alive.
Hello there everyone! My name is Branon, and I'm the founder of the AXN Creative. I never thought that my first blog post on behalf of this business would be during a global pandemic, but here we are. As you're reading this, I hope you're safe and well in the comfort of your home, but I know many of you are as busy as ever working essential jobs or continuing your work from home. Maybe some of you are having to find new work given the economic downturn from shutting the country down. And maybe others have their hands full with equally important work - parenthood, caretaking, or even adequate self-care.

Whatever you've got on your plate right now, I just wanted to take some time to check in with you. How are you? Are you staying sane? Are you maintaining your health? How has Coronavirus affected you and how are you responding? 

### A little bit about me. 
Before founding this business, I was the director of a neuropsychiatric clinic in Santa Barbara, CA. This was an awesome position consistent with my undergraduate interests and degree in behavioral neuroscience. Although I eventually gave into my creative / technical dispositions with this business, my whole life prior was devoted to the service of others' mental and physical health. It's something I'll carry with me forever. 

With that, I'm really interested in how you're all doing. If I'm being candid, it's been tough on not just this business but also on me. I've been blessed with health, companionship and support, and enough money to get by each week, but having so much of your life and future plans derailed inevitably takes its toll. And I know almost all of you are feeling that with me. As a guy with a longstanding passion for mental health, I guess I just wanted to level with you all and come alongside you. We're all in this together.  

### I'm serious - let's talk! 
Feel free to contact me. This isn't a business proposition - it's purely and honestly just a chance to connect with some of you and to show each other support during these trying times. I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys. Stay safe, well, and keep your head held high. 

We'll bounce back :)

Cheers!
Branon Eusebio

#### P.S.
I've been working on a really intuitive and sleek dashboard that displays realtime statistics and information on Coronavirus progression. Check that project out in our 'Projects' page or head straight there: [Coronavirus Tracker](https://dash-4-coronavirus.herokuapp.com/)

Stay safe & informed, friends!
